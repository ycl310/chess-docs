## More Info

This docs is intended to be included in one of my new projects which is not completed yet. Purpose is chess related, and I'm personally not an expert so I can't organize these alone, that's why I need contributors. Contributions are not paid as this is a open source project, though it is much appreciated and you'll be included in credits (as mentioned in src/contribute.md).
Thanks
